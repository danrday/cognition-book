## Require

The **require** tag mandates that a Javascript file must be loaded and executed before the *cog* containing its declaration is initialized. This tag is used to declare library dependencies for the entire application, but allows the load to be deferred until needed. 

### Require Tag Examples

```html
<require url="paws.js" />
<require url="kittenPower.js" path="JS_LIB" />
```

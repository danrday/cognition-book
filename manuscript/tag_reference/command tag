## Command

T> For explicitly creating actions that should trigger state changes.

A command tag creates a data tag and an associated sensor tag that watches it via the trigger attribute.

The sensor's trigger attribute and the data tag's name attribute are both set to the command tag's name.
While the command tag can watch, need or gather associated data using standard sensor features, it will only
be triggered by writes to its primary data tag.

Commands are a shorthand to explicitly label user actions in your application while restricting them to a single point
of entry.

### Command Tag Examples

```html
<command name="addTurtle_cmd" gather="turtleName,turtleType" transform="toTurtle" emit="request" pipe="addTurtle_net" />
<command name="activeTab_cmd" pipe="activeTab" />
```

## Data

T> Data tags hold all the data in observable boxes that have been stacked into a tree of implicit component-based scopes.

**TLDR**: Stores observable **data** on **cog**.  Watched by **sensors**. 

The **data** tag creates a named location owned and governed by the **cog** in which it is declared. Its name is required to be unique within the **cog**. The containing **cog** and its descendants can read, write and subscribe via **sensors** to the data contained within it. Child **cogs** can reference **data** locations above themselves by using the **prop** tag. Parent **cogs** have no direct access to the **data** contained within their children by design.  

### Data Tag Examples

```html
<data name="currentPage" />
<data name="furColor" value="red" prop="true" />
<data name="eyeColor" value="run determineEyeColor"  />
<data name="numArms" value="prop armCount" />
<data name="numLegs" value="number 4" />
<data name="dynamicConfig" value="config initialConfig" />
<data name="isHungry" value="true" inherit="true" />
<data name="theWordTrue" value="string true" />
```

### Data Tag Attributes

|Name | Description | [Types] & Options |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
|**name**| A unique name within the containing **cog** by which this **data** location may be referenced. | [string] |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
|value|  The initial value to be stored within this **data** location. By default, no value is assigned and it would read as undefined. Unless specified as a 'string' type, primitive values in the tag are automatically converted to true, false and null (see type *auto*). | [*auto*, any] |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
|inherit|  Set the inherit flag to true to override the initial set value with the value of a **data** location of the same name if there is a match higher up the **cog** hierarchy. | [bool] |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
|prop|  (Deprecated: will soon be true by default) Set the prop flag to true to expose the **data** location object as a property in the **cog's** script declaration. | [bool] |

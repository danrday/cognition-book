## Data

T> Data tags hold all the data in observable boxes that have been stacked into a tree of implicit component-based scopes.

The data tag creates a named storage point owned and governed by the cog in which it is declared.

Its name must be unique within the cog. The containing cog and its descendants can read, write and
subscribe via sensor tags to the data contained within it.

Child cogs can reference/expose data tags above themselves by using the prop tag.

Parent cogs have no direct access to the data contained within their children by design.

If the route attribute is set, the initial value of a data tag can be set via the url used to load the the application.

### Data Tag Examples

```html
<data name="currentPage" route="true" />
<data name="furColor" value="red" prop="true" />
<data name="eyeColor" value="run determineEyeColor"  />
<data name="numArms" value="prop armCount" />
<data name="numLegs" value="num 4" />
<data name="isHungry" value="true" inherit="true" />
<data name="theWordTrue" value="string true" />
```

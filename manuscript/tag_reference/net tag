## Net

T> Extends data tag functionality with network requests.

The net tag is a reusable network request and response feed paired with a data tag whose value is the last network response.

Net tags store response data on the data tag's default 'update' topic.

They initiate requests by watching for writes on the 'request' topic (possibly containing request parameters).
Additional request settings and parameters can be supplied as defaults via the service attribute.

The status of requests can be monitored by watching the 'condition' topic (possible values are 'busy', 'done' and 'error').

Order of precedence for settings and parameters (highest to lowest):


 1. Piped in on the request topic (overrides params)
 2. In-line attributes (except service)
 3. Service attribute


### Net Tag Examples

```html
<net name="currentUser" path="SVC_ROOT" url="getUser" />
<net name="updateFacility" url="UPDATE_FACILITY"  />
<net name="configSvc" service="run determineConfigSvc"  />
<net name="movies" url="/api/movies" verb="POST" params="prop dramaFilms/>
```

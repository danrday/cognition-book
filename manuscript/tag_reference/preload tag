## Preload

T> Preload expected files to expedite bulk downloads or avoid layout thrashing as child cogs load into view.

The preload tag requires that a file be loaded before the cog containing its declaration is initialized.
Preloaded files are simply stored in a cache containing their text context.

They are not executed and are not placed in the cog hierarchy.

### Preload Tag Examples

```html
<preload url="whiskers.js" />
<preload url="returnOfTheCats.html" path="CAT_COGS" />
`

### Preload Tag Attributes

: Relative file path, absolute file path or alias name.
  Resolves to file containing a cog definition that implements a display declaration
  (and possibly script or blueprint declarations).
  [*string*, data, prop, run, read]

path
: Relative or absolute directory path, prepended to the url. Can be another alias defined previously. [*string*]

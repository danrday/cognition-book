## Require

T> Makes sure that JavaScript libraries have already been run.

The require tag mandates that a JavaScript file must be loaded and executed before the cog containing its declaration is initialized.

This tag is used to declare library dependencies for the entire application, but allows the load to be deferred until needed.

### Require Tag Examples

```html
<require url="paws.js" />
<require url="kittenPower.js" path="JS_LIB" />
```

### Require Tag Attributes

url*
: Relative file path, absolute file path or alias name.
  Resolves to a JavaScript file. [*string*]

path
: Relative or absolute directory path, prepended to the url. Can be another alias defined previously. [*string*]

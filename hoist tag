## Hoist

The *hoist* tag loads a hidden *cog* above the *cog* in which it is declared. Hoisted *cogs* can act as libraries or state machines and do not use the *display* declaration. They can currently be stacked -- but not nested (yet).

### Hoist Tag Examples

```html
<hoist url="menuStateMachine.html" />
<hoist url="supplyChainFeed.html" path="APP_FEEDS" />
```

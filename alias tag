## Alias

TLDR: For your project, use this to safely move directories around, rename files, flip between versions of code, or refactor all the things. Update an **alias** or two and it all still works!

The **alias** tag provides a way to create references to specific URLs. Each of these can reference a parent **alias** via the path attribute in order to construct cascading paths. Although '../' is supported as a convenience, this tag is designed to discourage its usage.

Other cognition tags with 'url' or 'path' attributes can use **alias** names as values to handle file path resolution.

Using **alias** tags, one can rearrange the directory structure of an existing application without modifying the underlying code. 

By convention, the 'name' attribute of an **alias** tag is always fully capitalized with underscores between words.  

### Alias Tag Examples

```html
<alias name="CONTENT_ROOT" url="/public/app/html"  />
<alias name="PAGES"  url="pages" path="CONTENT_ROOT"  />
<alias name="CHART_PAGE" url="charts.html" path="PAGES" />
<alias name="CREDITS_PAGE" url="credits.html" path="PAGES" />
```

### Alias Tag Attributes

|Name | Description | [Types] & Options |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
|**name**| The actual string used to reference the alias. | [string] |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
|**url**|  A relative or absolute path to an actual file or directory. | [string] |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
|path|  A directory used as a prefix for the url attribute. It can be an actual relative or absolute path or the name of another **alias** defined previously. They can be chained together such that a change to a root **alias** can affect how every dependent *alias* resolves. | [string] |

## Alias tag

The *alias* tag provides a way to create references to specific URLs. Each of these can reference a parent *alias* via their path attribute in order to construct cascading paths, similar to a poor man's C macro. Although '../' is supported as a convenience, this tag is designed to discourage its usage.

```html
   <alias name="CONTENT_ROOT" url="/public/app/html"  />
   <alias name="PAGES"  url="pages" path="CONTENT_ROOT"  />
   <alias name="CHART_PAGE" url="charts.html" path="PAGES" />
   <alias name="CREDITS_PAGE" url="credits.html" path="PAGES" />
   <alias name="BACK_x3" url="../../../"  />
```

Using *alias* tags, one can rearrange the directory structure of an existing application without modifying the underlying code. 

### attributes

**name:** The actual string used to reference the alias.

**url:** The url is a relative or absolute path to an actual file. 

**path:** *(optional)* The *path* is an optional directory used as a prefix for the *url* attribute. It can be an actual path or the name of another *alias*. They can be chained together.

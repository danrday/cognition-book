## Alias

The *`alias`* tag provides a way to create references to specific URLs. Each of these can reference a parent *`alias`* via their path attribute in order to construct cascading paths, similar to a poor man's C macro. Although '../' is supported as a convenience, this tag is designed to discourage its usage.

Other cognition tags with url or path attributes can use alias names as values to handle file path resolution.

Using `alias` tags, one can rearrange the directory structure of an existing application without modifying the underlying code. 

For clarity (and as a nod to constants and macros), the name attributes of `alias` tags are always fully capitalized with underscores between words by convention.  

### Alias Tag Examples

```html
   <alias name="CONTENT_ROOT" url="/public/app/html"  />
   <alias name="PAGES"  url="pages" path="CONTENT_ROOT"  />
   <alias name="CHART_PAGE" url="charts.html" path="PAGES" />
   <alias name="CREDITS_PAGE" url="credits.html" path="PAGES" />
   <alias name="BACK_x3" url="../../../"  />
```

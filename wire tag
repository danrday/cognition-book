## Wire

The *wire* tag includes additional *blueprint* and *script* functionality on (as if just above) the *cog* in which it is declared. *Wires* can act as libraries or state machines and do not use the *display* declaration. They can currently be stacked -- but not nested within other *wires* (yet).

### Wire Tag Examples

```html
<wire url="menuStateMachine.html" />
<wire url="supplyChainFeed.html" path="APP_FEEDS" />
```

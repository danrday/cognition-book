## Alloy

The *alloy* tag includes additional *blueprint* and *script* functionality on (as if just above) the *cog* in which it is declared. *Alloys* can act as libraries or state machines and do not have a *display* declaration. They can be stacked within a *cog*, but they cannot be nested within other *alloys*.

The *script* contents of an *alloy* are exposed on the *script* of the containing *cog* as a property based on the *alloy's* *name* attribute.

### Alloy Tag Examples

```html
<alloy url="menuStateMachine.html" />
<alloy url="supplyChainFeed.html" path="APP_FEEDS" />
```

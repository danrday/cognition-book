# Design Goals

In general, frameworks get a pretty bad rap. They are bemoaned from one side for their enormous bloat; they are denigrated for their lack of features from the other. Developers working within them quickly find limitations and constraints imposed from above in order to satisfy the framework's strange sense of rightness or purity, edginess or Victorian convention.

What begins as an application's foundation can, in the end, become its cage. More time is spent 'working around the framework' than is gained through its presence. No one wants to be in this situation.

Every application of sufficient complexity and scope has a framework. The framework is just 'the how' and 'the why' and 'the glue' holding an application together. Sometimes, it makes sense to build exactly what you need; the framework and the application become nearly indistinguishable beasts. 

Off-the-shelf frameworks only work when the design goals of the framework are in alignment with the actual needs of an application. Even the best written, most professional and elegant of frameworks will be detrimental to a project if each seeks a separate purpose.

The *Cognition* framework has a very specific set of design goals and interests. First and foremost, it is tailored for the creation of large, sprawling single-page web-applications, i.e. the kind of thing you're likely to find on a corporate intranet. It is able to load and unload tons of random sub-sites from all over. It assumes that programmers are fallible and messy and makes an honest attempt to clean things up. If one group wants to use Kendo components and another wants to visualize things in D3, it gives them the leeway to use their preferred tools. It caters to large teams -- as they can encapsulate functionality completely within their modules. And it handles all the routing and deep-linking automatically.

But *Cognition* does not handle SEO. Search engines are nearly blind to *Cognition* applications. Public, consumer-facing websites that desire the intrusion of web crawlers and ninja bots are not well served by this framework. Page rank will not be theirs.

*Cognition* also requires modern ES5-capable browsers. No attempt has been made to sustain legacy systems.

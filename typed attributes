# Typed Attributes

Some tag attributes support a type prefix to allow for more complexity (or even clarity). Typed attribute values are preceded by a type name and a space.

### data
A *cog* can load various URLs dynamically by using a *url* attribute typed as *data*.

```html
<cog find="holder" url="data currentPage" />
```

In this case, the DOM element with an *id* of *holder* would always contain a *cog* whose URL was obtained from a *data* tag named currentPage. If the value of currentPage changed, a new *cog* would be loaded, replacing the prior one, using the value of currentPage as its URL.

### config

A config attribute will be resolved upon instantiation and does not respond to changes; it's a once and done setup variable.

```html
<cog find="holder" url="config currentPage" />
```

In this example, the *cog* will load whatever URL string is contained within the *config* option named currentPage.

### string

For *cogs*, the default type for the 'url' attribute is 'string'.

```html
<cog find="holderA" url="cats_of_the_world.html" />
<cog find="holderB" url="string cats_of_the_world.html" />
```

These example statements are thus equivalent. They would both load 'cats_of_the_world.html'.

### prop

```html
<cog find="holder" url="string cats_of_the_world.html" />
```

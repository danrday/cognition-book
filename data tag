## Data

The *data* tag creates a named location owned and governed by the *cog* in which it is declared. Its name is required to be unique only within this cog. The containing cog and its descendants can read, write and subscribe via *sensors* to the data contained within it. Parent cogs have no direct access to the *data* contained within their children by design. 

### Data Tag Examples

```html
<data name="currentPage" />
<data name="furColor" value="red" prop="true" />
<data name="eyeColor" value="run determineEyeColor"  />
<data name="numArms" value="prop armCount" />
<data name="numLegs" value="number 4" />
<data name="dynamicConfig" value="config configFromFile" />
<data name="isHungry" value="true" inherit="true" />
<data name="theWordTrue" value="string true" />
```
